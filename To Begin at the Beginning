As I'm studying the infomation seeking behaviour of communities of practice in the phenomenon of ai as well as engaging in that behaviour myself, I will be taking notes on my process on here as well, I am a complete novie here but seemed like this would be the best place to take those note's. As I have noticed there is no text wrapping here by default, I'm going to make each entry on a differnt line, it might prove too annoying but we'll see. Anyhow I'm about to start watching LinedIn Learning's coursre "Git Essential training: the Basics" as I realised I couldn't just woek it all out from opening the 'startup workflow'

Ok I have started a tutorial repositry on github desktop, So I dont have to keep an update on here as I nut out all the basic processes and admin of Github. I did have to choose a text edior, I thought possibility of dreameaver just because that"s all I have had much experiance with other then other then note++ anyhow I decided on Visual Studio pro https://code.visualstudio.com/ .
